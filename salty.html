        <h3>Turkish begels simit</h3>
        <br>
    <p>Simit is a circular bread, typically encrusted with sesame seeds or, less commonly, poppy, flax or 
        sunflower seeds, found across the cuisines of the former Ottoman Empire, and the Middle East, especially 
        in Armenia, Turkey and the Balkans. Simit's size, crunch, chewiness, and other characteristics vary
         slightly by region. In İzmir, simit is known as gevrek ("crisp"), although it is very similar to the 
         Istanbul variety. Simit in Ankara are smaller and crisper than those of other cities.</p>
